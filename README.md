## Welcome FIS Code Girls!

We are super excited that you decided to join us in learning how to code. It is a lot of fun, and is easy to learn once you get started. It is important that everyone helps eachother out, and that you ask questions if you are stuck! The best developers are the ones that ask for help often :)

### Before We Get Started:

Please make sure you have created your [github account](https://github.com/), and have downloaded a text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/). If you don't have the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) on your computer, we recommend downloading that too since we will be using it for most of our examples. If you get stuck with any of these steps, please let us know before we start with the workshop.

### Agenda for Today

**1. Inspecting the Web**

> What makes up our favourite web pages? What tools do developers use to help visualize how their code will look in the browser?

_Activity #1: Go to your favourite website and inspect it!_

* How would you make it better?
* Play around with the code and see what funny changes you can make to the text and the styles.

Here's some more fun sites for inspiration:
* https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/
* https://insidethehead.co/ 
* http://oatthegoat.co.nz/ 
* https://crypton.trading/
* https://christopherlis.com/projects/particle-surge
* http://eeerik.com/ 

**2. Building a Webpage Together**

> Let's take a look at this Code Girls webpage. What elements do you see? What styles do you see? Together we will learn about HTML & CSS, and how the work together to create a webpage.

_Activity #2: Together we will create the Code Girls webpage._

1. Start by looking at/finding a design that we want to create. 
2. Draw out the elements we need on paper. 
3. Write the HTML which creates the elements. 
4. Lastly, the fun part - add the CSS (styles)!

Element Cheat Sheet:

```
<div>
  I am used as a wrapper or container element. You can organize or group other elements inside me :)
</div>
```

```
<p>
  I am a paragraph element. I can be used for any text that is not a title.
</p>
```

```
<h1>
  I am a heading element. I am the biggest and most important heading. I usually can be found at the top of the page.
</h1>

<h2>
  I am the second most important heading (sub-heading). 
</h2>

// There are heading elements starting from h1 (the biggest) until h6 (the tiniest).
```

```
<ul>
 <li>I am a list item!</li>
 <li>I am another list item!</li>
 <li>I am another list item!</li>
</ul>

// Here we have an 'unordered list' element
```

```
<img src="image.png">

// This is an image element. It doesn't need the closing tag because we don't need to put any content inside of it. The image has an attribute called 'src' (source), which tells it which image to show.
```

```
<a href="www.google.com">
  Click me!
</a>

// This is link element or 'anchor tag'. The 'href' attribute tells us the location to redirect to when we click.
```

**3. Build Your Own Webpage!**

> So now how do we create our own webpage? Plan out how you want your website to look by drawing it on paper first. 

_Activity #3: Create your custom profile page._

* You can use the base we created in the previous section, or start again from scratch! Go crazy, be creative and make it your own.

Try to use the following elements:

- div, p, h1, img and ul
 
...and the following CSS properties:

- Display, color, background, font-size, font-family, padding, margin

Challenge: Can you make your website elements change when you hover the mouse over them? What other elements and styles can you use?

[Pssst! Here's a helpful hint for more style properties!](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/)

**4. Make Your Website Go Live!**

> Now let's share your page with the world! We will now learn the easiest way to get your website up and running on the web so others can see it too. 

_Activity #4: Upload your files to Github Pages._

* Login to your github account and create a new repository (project). 
* When you are happy with your webpage, drag in the files and 'commit' them. You will see the link to your live website!
* Once it's live, we will link each person's url to the Code Girls Website that recreated together in Part 2.
* Now you can share your link with your friends! Also, if you want to keep working and making changes, just copy your new code into the corresponding file on github and make a new commit.
